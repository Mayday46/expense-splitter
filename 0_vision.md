# Project Vision

## Problem
To eliminate the friction and awkwardness in group expenses by creating an automated, intuitive system that handles the entire process from receipt to repayment - make shared finances among friends as seamless as sending a text message.

## Target User
Primary: Close friends, roommates, and partner who share frequent expenses (dining, travel, groceries, utilities)

## Success Metric
    - Technical Validation (Phase 1)
        1. Receipt Processing: AWS Textract amounts with > 90% accuracy.
        2. Notification System: SNS delivers 95%+ of payment reminders successfully.
        3. Data Integrity: DynamoDB maintains 100% expense/payment record accuracy.
        4. Performance: Receipt-to-split workflow completes in < 15 seconds
        5. Responsiveness: App functions perfectly on mobile devices (primary use case)

## Why Software?
Existing tools solve the mathematical problem of splitting bills but ignore the social problem of shared finances. We solve both simultaneously.
